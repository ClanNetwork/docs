# About Clan Network

Clan Network is a gaming blockchain on a mission to realize the full potential of Web3 gaming.&#x20;

Current Web3 solutions are centralized and siloed. They promise to grant gamers with true ownership over their in-game assets, but they fall short. In-game assets are still only usable and tradable in specific, siloed blockchains (i.e. Wax, Polygon, Solana).Clan Network is set to free these in-game assets from their captive chains, enabling multi chain compatibility, making these assets truly usable and liquide anywhere.

Clan aims to provide a superior development and gaming experience with unprecedented capabilities, by leveraging cutting-edge developments on the Cosmos ecosystem such as IBC, Starport, privacy through the Secret Network, and interchain security, which in turn unlocks countless use cases for Web3 gaming.
