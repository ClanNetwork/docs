# Introduction

## Clan Network

Clan Network is a gaming blockchain on a mission to realize the full potential of Web3 gaming. Current Web3 solutions are centralized and siloed. They promise to grant gamers with true ownership over their in-game assets, but they fall short. In-game assets are still only usable and tradable in specific, siloed blockchains (i.e. Wax, Polygon, Solana). Clan Network is set to free these in-game assets from their captive chains, enabling multi chain compatibility, making these assets truly usable and liquide anywhere.

Clan aims to provide a superior development and gaming experience with unprecedented capabilities, by leveraging cutting-edge developments on the Cosmos ecosystem such as IBC, Starport, privacy through the Secret Network, and interchain security. In the spirit of Web3, Clan Network is a community-led project to the utmost degree. Clan’s core contributors, validators, and founding partners are some of the most experienced and capable development teams in Cosmos and crypto gaming.

## Web3 gaming&#x20;

\
The transition from web2 to web3 gaming offers a new economic model: Play to Earn (“P2E”). While P2E is a valuable innovation in and of itselfIt is key to recognize that Web3 gaming is a much bigger, broader concept than P2E. In the past decade, the gaming industry has gone through major shifts: (1) from single player to massive multipliers; (2) from single purchases to subscriptions, freemium, and in-game purchases (3) and last but not least from closed environments to open source and create to earn (“C2E”) platform as spearheaded by gaming giants such as Minecraft and Overwolf. Moreover, the rise of the metaverse and extended reality technology (XR, VR, AR) will help shape new economic models, in a similar fashion to how P2E and C2E had emerged.&#x20;

Web3 is the next, natural step in this evolution. Web3 is the future of gaming, and Clan is here to lead the way.

## The gaming market

In 2021 global gaming revenue reached over $180B. In-app purchases have recently gone higher than $10B/month. Virtually none of these user spending has any value outside of the single app or game they are using! By connecting applications and decentralizing ownership of in-game assets, the utility and value of what users purchase grows astronomically. Most importantly, the players directly benefit from the interoperability and cross-platform value.

The Gaming industry serves as the best testament of mass adoption and technologies going mainstream, and we believe that through this huge market, Web3 applications can become a worldwide standard. Online gaming market is anticipated to reach $18.5 billion by 2025 with a CAGR of 4.1% in the Forecast period 2020-2025, mainly due to the increased spending on online games and the growing penetration of smartphones & tablets. Also, availability of high-speed internet connectivity and reliable network is also one of the key factors fueling the demand for online gaming solutions and services. Moreover, constant improvements in network connectivity and advancements in AR, VR, and XR technologies are estimated to provide key growth opportunities for the iGaming market.

## **Why** Cosmos multi-chain

The vision of Cosmos is to make it easy for developers to build blockchains and break the barriers between blockchains by allowing them to transact with each other. The end goal is to create an Internet of Blockchains: a network of blockchains able to communicate with each other in a decentralized way. This aligns with the Web3 movement and Clan Network's vision and values perfectly. Moreover, we gained considerable experience in Cosmos’s ecosystem in the past year which allows us to design tailored solutions for this promising ecosystem.

Cosmos is “the internet of blockchains”, pioneering a multi-chain vision that break the barriers between different blockchains, allowing them to transact with each other. At a very high level, the multichain vision preaches the following progression: 1) From a single, application specific chain (Bitcoin) -> to a single, numerous applications chain (Ethereum) -> and finally, to a nomerus application specific blockchains. This aligns perfectly with the Web3 and Clan Network's vision, and why we chose building on Cosmos.

We are utilizing Cosmos projects such as IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol) and Interchain Security to provide new capabilities for web3 game developers and gamers. Also, we believe that in the long run, complex games will require independent infrastructure & parameters. In this aspect Cosmos’s Hub/Zone structure allows us to offer scalable,decentralized solutions to games of all shapes and sizes.

## **Clan network: A community owned Web3 gaming ecosystem**

Clan Network is building upon these market leading trends, aiming to serve as a decentralized hub for Web3 gaming, where gamers and game developers can leverage innovative blockchain technologies to stretch the boundaries of the current market standards.

In the spirit of Web3, Clan Network is a community-led project to the utmost degree. Accordingly, the distribution of the network’s native token, $CLAN, is designed to reward the most active contributors by default: Game devs, network core devs and validators.

In contrast to existing gaming-oriented chains such as Solana, Polygon, Wax, and Flow, when games and apps developers contribute to Clan, they receive partial ownership over the network. Clan is not run by a centralized dev shop, rather, it is a community-led project, where contributors are compensated with ownership.
