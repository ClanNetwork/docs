# Our approach

Clan Network is aiming to serve as a decentralized hub for Web3 gaming, where gamers and game developers can leverage innovative blockchain technologies to stretch the boundaries of the current market standards.

In the spirit of Web3, Clan Network is a community-led project to the utmost degree. Accordingly, the distribution of the networkâ€™s native token, $CLAN, is designed to reward the most active contributors by default: Game devs, network core devs and validators.

In contrast to existing gaming-oriented chains such as Solana, Polygon, Wax, and Flow, when games and apps developers contribute to Clan, they receive partial ownership over the network. Clan is not run by a centralized dev shop, rather, it is a community-led project, where contributors are compensated with ownership.
