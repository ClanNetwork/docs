# Zero knowledge proof

ZKP is a system where one can prove to a verifier that a statement is true without revealing any additional information. Utilizing Zero-knowledge proof, the blockchain gaming industry can introduce a more profound experience for gamers. The implications of ZKP can come into action in the two types of games: complete and incomplete information games.

Complete information games are games where all of the players know all of the information within the game ecosystem; an excellent example of such a game is chess, where all players know exactly where all the board pieces are at any given moment.

Incomplete information games are games where the game's information should stay private, so not all game players share all of the available information. An example of such a game is Poker, where players keep their cards in hand private.

By utilizing ZKP modules, Clan Network can provide game developers the option to build games that require information to stay private.
