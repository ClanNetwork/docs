# About the IBC protocol

Inter blockchain communication is a new generation of protocols. The IBC protocol provides a long-term solution to cross-chain communication in a secured and reliable manner. Structured by top-notch developers in the industry, IBC is built from 2 layers. The first provides an infrastructure to facilitate connection and authentication between chains, while the second, the application layer, opens the opportunity to build a wide range of cross-chain applications.

By utilizing the IBC protocol Clan Network can allow her game developers to create and deploy cross-chain applications. Furthermore, we will provide the ability to have interoperability between the various games and applications launched on Clan Network.
