# Cosmos multi chain

Cosmos is “the internet of blockchains”, pioneering a multi-chain vision that break the barriers between different blockchains, allowing them to transact with each other. At a very high level, the multichain vision preaches the following progression: 1) From a single, application specific chain (Bitcoin) -> to a single, numerous applications chain (Ethereum) -> and finally, to a nomerus application specific blockchains.

This aligns perfectly with the Web3 and Clan Network's vision, and why we chose building on Cosmos. We are utilizing Cosmos projects such as IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol) and Interchain Security to provide new capabilities for web3 game developers and gamers.

Also, we believe that in the long run, complex games will require independent infrastructure & parameters. In this aspect Cosmos’s Hub/Zone structure allows us to offer scalable,decentralized solutions to games of all shapes and sizes.
