# Inter-chain Security

In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks, validators secure the network by staking a coin or a token and validating new data on the block. The higher the staked value in the network, the more secure the network.Smaller chains are more vulnerable to attacks on the network due to low staked value. Therefore, the cosmos network brings a new solution called "Inter-chain Security."

By utilizing the same validator set as Cosmos, smaller chains or "consumer chains" can enjoy the complete security of Cosmos.Clan Network will utilize Interchain Security to provide game developers and users the option to have the security of a leading chain from day one.&#x20;
