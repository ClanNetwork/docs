# The Web3 gaming promise

The transition from web2 to web3 gaming introduced a new economic model: Play to Earn (“P2E”). While P2E is a valuable innovation in and of itselfIt is key to recognize that Web3 gaming is a much bigger, broader concept than P2E.

In the past decade, the gaming industry has gone through major shifts: (1) from single player to massive multipliers; (2) from single purchases to subscriptions, freemium, and in-game purchases (3) and last but not least from closed environments to open source and create to earn (“C2E”) platform as spearheaded by gaming giants such as Minecraft and Overwolf. Moreover, the rise of the metaverse and extended reality technology (XR, VR, AR) will help shape new economic models, in a similar fashion to how P2E and C2E had emerged. Web3 is the next, natural step in this evolution. Web3 is the future of gaming, and Clan is here to lead the way.
