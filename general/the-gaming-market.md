# The gaming market

In 2021 global gaming revenue reached over $180B. In-app purchases have recently gone higher than $10B/month. Virtually none of these user spending has any value outside of the single app or game they are using! By connecting applications and decentralizing ownership of in-game assets, the utility and value of what users purchase grows astronomically. Most importantly, the players directly benefit from the interoperability and cross-platform value.

The Gaming industry serves as the best testament of mass adoption and technologies going mainstream, and we believe that through this huge market, Web3 applications can become a worldwide standard. Online gaming market is anticipated to reach $18.5 billion by 2025 with a CAGR of 4.1% in the Forecast period 2020-2025, mainly due to the increased spending on online games and the growing penetration of smartphones & tablets.

Also, availability of high-speed internet connectivity and reliable network is also one of the key factors fueling the demand for online gaming solutions and services. Moreover, constant improvements in network connectivity and advancements in AR, VR, and XR technologies are estimated to provide key growth opportunities for the iGaming market.
